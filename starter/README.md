##Introduction

The Trivia API is a RESTful API that supports queries and updates to trivia questions.
A client application can retrieve existing questions and answers in the form of quizzes,
and can also add to and delete from the pool of questions. In addition to being viewable by
category, questions are each marked with a difficulty level. Questions can be searched for 
by keyword or by word fragment.


##Getting Started

Base URL: The backend server may be run on the localhost on port 5000, which is set
as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or
API keys.

Error Handling: Errors are returned as JSON objects in this format:

{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad request"
}

The API may return 3 error types when requests fail:
   400: Bad request
   404: Resource not found
   422: Not processable


##Resource endpoint library

GET /categories

    Returns a categories object containing category id as key and category name as value, 
    plus a success value.

    Sample: curl http://localhost:5000/categories

    {
        "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art", 
        "3": "Geography", 
        "4": "History", 
        "5": "Entertainment", 
        "6": "Sports"
        }, 
        "success": true
    }

GET /questions 
GET /questions?page=<int:id>

    Note that all endpoints that return questions 
    (/questions, /categories/<id>/questions, and questions/search)
    return the same information. 
    
    Returns the categories object, a currentCategory field (may be null), a questions object with
    question number as key and a question object as the value, a total_questions value and a success value.

    currentCategory will be null if the questions returned are not from a particular category.
    The total_questions value reflects the total number of questions that could be returned
    without pagination.

    Not specifying a page number will result in page 1 being returned, with QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE
    (set to 10) questions being shown on each full page. 

    Sample:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/questions?page=2
    {
    "categories": {

GET /categories/<int:id>/questions
GET /categories<int:id>/questions?page=<int:id>

    This endpoint is similar to the /questions endpoint, except that only questions of
    the specified category are returned. The category is specified as an integer
    in the endpoint url. Similar to the /questions endpoint, if the page attribute is omitted
    from the url, then page 1 results are returned.

    Sample:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/categories/1/questions
    {
    "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art", 
        "3": "Geography", 
        "4": "History", 
        "5": "Entertainment", 
        "6": "Sports"

        "difficulty": 4, 
        "id": 20, 
        "question": "What is the heaviest organ in the human body?"
        }, 
        "2": {
        "answer": "Alexander Fleming", 
        "category": 1, 
        "difficulty": 3, 
        "id": 21, 
        "question": "Who discovered penicillin?"
        }, 
        "3": {
        "answer": "Blood", 
        "category": 1, 
        "difficulty": 4, 
        "id": 22, 
        "question": "Hematology is a branch of medicine involving the study of what?"
        }
    }, 
    "success": true, 
    "total_questions": 3
    }

    can be specified for search), the questions object of objects, a success value, and
