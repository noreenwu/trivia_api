# Project: Trivia API

## Introduction

The Trivia application allows its users to maintain a categorized database of
questions and answers as well as to run trivia quizzes. In addition to being viewable by
category, questions are each marked with a difficulty level. Questions can be searched for 
by keyword or by word fragment.

The front-end of this application is written in React and the database is Postgres. 
In between these two pieces is the Trivia API, written in Python and Flask-SQLAlchemy. 
This document describes how to use the Trivia API, as well as how to install and
run the Trivia application.

## Running the Application

It is assumed that the following technologies are already available on your platform:
Python 3.7, pip and node.

Download the repository at https://github.com/noreenwu/trivia_api and cd into
starter/backend.

### Database

Create the Postgres database "trivia," and populate it with the schema and initial data.

     createdb trivia
     psql trivia < trivia.psql

### Back-end

From starter/backend, run "pip install -r requirements.txt", which 
will install the rest of the backend dependencies. To run the server, issue the
following commands:

    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

The server will run in development mode on port 5000. The source file being executed
resides in the subdirectory flaskr and is called __init__.py. To verify that the server
is running, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.


### Front-end

From the front-end folder (starter/frontend), use npm to install the dependencies:

   npm install

Then start the frontend service with:

   npm start


The front-end can be accessed from your browser by going to http://localhost:3000.


### Tests

In order to run tests, navigate to the starter/backend folder and create the
test database, which will parallel the database used by the front-end application.

    createdb trivia_test
    psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
    python test_flaskr.py

If the Trivia application is extended, accompanying tests should also be kept
updated in the test_flaskr.py file.


## API Reference: Getting Started

Base URL: The backend server may be run on the localhost on port 5000, which is set
as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or
API keys.

Error Handling: Errors are returned as JSON objects in this format:

{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "Bad request"
}

The API may return 3 error types when requests fail:
   400: Bad request
   404: Resource not found
   422: Not processable


## Resource endpoint library

GET /categories

    Returns a categories object containing category id as key and category name as value, 
    plus a success value.

    Sample: curl http://localhost:5000/categories

    {
        "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art", 
        "3": "Geography", 
        "4": "History", 
        "5": "Entertainment", 
        "6": "Sports"
        }, 
        "success": true
    }

GET /questions 

GET /questions?page=<int:id>

    Note that all endpoints that return questions 
    (/questions, /categories/<id>/questions, and questions/search)
    return the same information. 
    
    Returns the categories object, a currentCategory field (may be null), a questions object with
    question number as key and a question object as the value, a total_questions value and a success value.

    currentCategory will be null if the questions returned are not from a particular category.
    The total_questions value reflects the total number of questions that could be returned
    without pagination.

    Not specifying a page number will result in page 1 being returned, with QUESTIONS_PER_PAGE
    (set to 10) questions being shown on each full page. 

    Sample:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/questions?page=2
    {
    "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art",

GET /categories/<int:id>/questions

GET /categories<int:id>/questions?page=<int:id>

    This endpoint is similar to the /questions endpoint, except that only questions of
    the specified category are returned. The category is specified as an integer
    in the endpoint url. Similar to the /questions endpoint, if the page attribute is omitted
    from the url, then page 1 results are returned.

    Sample:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/categories/1/questions
    {
    "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art", 
        "3": "Geography", 
        "4": "History", 
        "5": "Entertainment", 
        "6": "Sports"
    }, 
    "currentCategory": 1, 
    "questions": {
        "1": {
        "answer": "The Liver", 
        "category": 1, 
        "difficulty": 4, 
        "id": 20, 
        "question": "What is the heaviest organ in the human body?"
        }, 
        "2": {
        "answer": "Alexander Fleming", 
        "category": 1, 
        "difficulty": 3, 
        "id": 21, 
        "question": "Who discovered penicillin?"
        }, 
        "3": {
        "answer": "Blood", 
        "category": 1, 
        "difficulty": 4, 
        "id": 22, 
        "question": "Hematology is a branch of medicine involving the study of what?"
        }
    }, 
    "success": true, 
    "total_questions": 3
    }

POST /questions/search

    Returns a list of questions that match the end user's search term or fragment, in
    the same format as the /questions and /categories/<id>/questions endpoints described above.
    That is, included are the categories object, the currentCategory (null since no category
    can be specified for search), the questions object of objects, a success value, and
    the total questions matching the search term.

    The search term or pattern and the page number must be passed in as a json
    object. 

    The maximum number of returned questions is the number of questions per page, (set to 10).

    Sample:

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/questions/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "searchTerm": "title", "page": 1 }' -X POST
    {
    "categories": {
        "1": "Science", 
        "2": "Art", 
        "3": "Geography", 
        "4": "History", 
        "5": "Entertainment", 
        "6": "Sports"
    }, 
    "currentCategory": null, 
    "questions": {
        "1": {
        "answer": "Maya Angelou",

    }, 
    "success": true, 
    "total_questions": 2
    }


DELETE /questions/<int:id>

    Deletes the question of the specified ID, if it exists. On successful deletion, a success value is returned.

    If the specified question does not exist, error code 400 is returned.

    Sample:
    $ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/questions/131
    {
    "deleted": 131, 
    "success": true
    }


POST /questions/add

    Creates a new question in the database. Required data includes the question text, the answer text,
    a difficulty rating and a category. A success value is returned on successful creation of the new question.

    Sample:
    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/questions/add -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is a baby goat called?", "answer": "kid", "difficulty": 1, "category": 1}'
    {
    "success": true
    }

     Takes as input an array of previous questions that the user has already seen and a quiz category.
     Returns a question object, success value, and the total number of questions in the specified category.
     Does not return questions that are in the previous_questions array.

     Example input:

       { 'previous_questions': [], 
         'quiz_category': { 'type': 'Science', 'id': 1} }


    Sample: 

    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/quizzes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "previous_questions": [], "quiz_category": {"type": "Science", "id": 1 }}'
    {

I would like to thank my kids for adding difficult trivia questions to the application, for
pointing out that the cursor should be a pointer, and for generally being interested in the project.
